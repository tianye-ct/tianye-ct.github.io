# Building Mox AI - A Modern AI Platform Architecture

In this post, I'll share the technical journey of building Mox AI, an enterprise-grade AI platform that leverages cutting-edge technologies to deliver scalable, performant AI solutions.

## The Vision

Mox AI was born from the need to create a unified platform that could:
- Handle multiple LLM providers seamlessly
- Implement efficient RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) at scale
- Provide real-time AI interactions with minimal latency
- Ensure data persistence and security for enterprise use

## Tech Stack Deep Dive

### Frontend: Next.js 14 with App Router

We chose Next.js for its:
- **Server-side rendering** for optimal SEO and performance
- **React Server Components** to reduce client-side JavaScript
- **Built-in API routes** for lightweight endpoints
- **TypeScript support** for type safety across the codebase

```typescript
// Example of a React Server Component in Next.js
async function ChatInterface() {
  const session = await getServerSession();
  const messages = await fetchMessages(session.userId);
  
  return <ChatUI initialMessages={messages} />;
}
```

### Backend: FastAPI + Pydantic

FastAPI provides:
- **Async request handling** for high concurrency
- **Automatic API documentation** with OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Pydantic integration** for robust data validation

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ChatMessage(BaseModel):
    content: str
    model: str = "gpt-4"
    temperature: float = 0.7

@app.websocket("/ws/chat")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    await websocket.accept()
    # Handle real-time chat
```

### Vector Search: Milvus

For implementing RAG, we use Milvus because:
- **Billion-scale vector similarity search**
- **Multiple index types** for different use cases
- **GPU acceleration** support
- **Distributed architecture** for scalability

### Data Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL**: Relational data, user management, and audit logs
- **MinIO**: S3-compatible object storage for documents and media
- **Redis**: Caching layer and message queue for async tasks

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Microservices vs Monolith
We opted for a modular monolith approach initially, with clear service boundaries that can be extracted into microservices as we scale.

### 2. Real-time Communication
WebSockets for chat functionality with fallback to Server-Sent Events for compatibility.

### 3. Vector Storage Strategy
Hybrid approach using both Milvus for semantic search and PostgreSQL with pgvector for smaller datasets.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Token Management
Implementing a token pooling system to efficiently manage API limits across multiple LLM providers.

### Scalability
Using Redis Streams for job queuing and horizontal scaling of worker processes.

### Security
JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens and row-level security in PostgreSQL.

## What's Next?

- Multi-modal AI support (images, audio)
- Plugin architecture for custom integrations
- Enhanced monitoring and observability
- Open-sourcing core components

## Conclusion

Building Mox AI has been an exciting journey in creating a modern AI platform that balances performance, scalability, and developer experience. The combination of Next.js, FastAPI, and purpose-built databases like Milvus provides a solid foundation for AI applications.
